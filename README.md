## Liberation

```
In the feudal age, peasants were bound to the land.
In the industrial age, workers were bound to the assembly line.
In the information age, programmers are bound to their desks.

In the AI age, it's time for liberation.
```

**Liberate Space** — No longer chained to your workstation
**Liberate Time** — Even 5-minute fragments become productive
**Liberate Hands** — Voice input, speak instead of type
**Liberate Mind** — Focus on creativity, let AI handle execution

---

## Philosophy

### Natural Language Controls Everything

**The old way:**
```
You → Learn commands → Computer
      (ssh, git, grep, find, curl, docker...)
      (Hard to remember, easy to mess up)
```

**The new way:**
```
You → Natural language → Claude → Computer
      ("Check if there are any 500 errors in yesterday's logs")
      (Claude knows the commands)
```

Claude becomes the **translation layer** between you and your computer:
- You speak human language, Claude translates to machine commands
- No need to memorize syntax
- No need to worry about typos
- As long as Claude understands your intent, it works

**What can Claude do?**
- Write code, fix bugs, run tests
- Search files, check logs, read configs
- Make HTTP requests, call APIs, run scripts
- Manage git, handle processes, deploy services
- **Everything the command line can do**

**What do you need to do?**
- Just express your intent
- "Help me check if nginx has any 500 errors recently"
- "Package this project and deploy to staging"
- "Count how many records are in the users table"

**Don't worry about getting commands right — just make sure Claude understands you.**

### Save Your Time for Thinking

Claude handles the execution — the commands, the syntax, the tedious details. You focus on what matters: ideas, architecture, creativity.

In the AI age, **imagination is your greatest asset**. Don't waste it on memorizing flags and options. Let Claude be your translator, and keep your mind free for what only humans can do: **dream, create, and innovate**.

## Vibe Coding

A new way of programming:

- **Think** → **Speak** → **Walk away** → **Come back to results**
- Your job: ideas, decisions, creativity
- Claude's job: execution, translation, implementation

### Fragment Time Programming

Traditional programming requires large time blocks — at least 1-2 hours to "get in the zone."

With Claude Remote:
- **5 minutes** is enough to make progress
- Waiting for elevator? Check the progress
- Waiting for food delivery? Give feedback
- On the subway? Send a new instruction
- **No "getting in the zone" needed** — Claude maintains the context

Fragment time adds up to **real productivity**.

### Multi-Session Parallel

Claude spends 70% of the time outputting. Waiting is waste.

<img src="screenshots/multi-session.jpg" width="300" alt="Multi-Session">

Run 3-4 tasks simultaneously:
- Session A is generating → Switch to Session B, give instructions
- Session B is thinking → Switch to Session C, review output
- Session C done → Back to Session A, continue

**One person, 3-4x efficiency.**

### Voice-Driven

Your phone's keyboard has voice input built-in.

- Speak instead of type
- Eyes closed, lying down, still coding
- "Add form validation to the login page" → Send → Done

**Truly hands-free.**

### Built with Itself

This project was developed using Claude Remote. After the core features were complete, all subsequent development was done via voice input on a phone — during commutes, while walking, in bed.

**Everything you see here was created by Claude Code:**
- 📝 This README — written and translated
- 🎬 The demo GIF — frames extracted from screen recording, composed automatically
- 🖼️ All screenshots — extracted, cropped, and sensitive info masked
- 🌍 9 language translations — i18n files with 200+ entries each

Proof that vibe coding works.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- macOS or Linux
- Python 3.10+
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and authenticated

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AndrewChen2013/claude-remote.git
cd claude-remote

# Run management script
chmod +x deploy/manage.sh
./deploy/manage.sh
```

**First Run:** The script will automatically:
- Create Python virtual environment
- Install dependencies
- Generate a random AUTH_TOKEN
- Start the service

**Subsequent Runs:** Shows an interactive menu:

```
  1) Start service
  2) Stop service
  3) Restart service
  4) View logs

  5) Enable auto-start on boot
  6) Disable auto-start on boot

  7) Reinstall dependencies

  0) Exit
```

**Features:**
- Service management (start/stop/restart)
- Real-time log viewing
- Auto-start on boot (macOS LaunchAgent / Linux systemd)
- Dependency installation and updates

### Access

**Local Network:**
```
http://<your-computer-ip>:8000
```

**Remote Access (Optional):**

If you need access from outside your local network, [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) is one simple option:

```bash
# Install cloudflared
brew install cloudflared

# Create tunnel
cloudflared tunnel create claude-remote

# Configure tunnel (edit ~/.cloudflared/config.yml)
tunnel: <tunnel-id>
credentials-file: ~/.cloudflared/<tunnel-id>.json

ingress:
  - hostname: claude.yourdomain.com
    service: http://localhost:8000
  - service: http_status:404

# Start tunnel
cloudflared tunnel run claude-remote
```

Now access from anywhere: `https://claude.yourdomain.com`

> ⚠️ **Security Warning**
> - Exposing services to the internet carries inherent risks
> - If you're on a corporate network, **consult your network administrator** before setting up any tunnel
> - Consider your organization's security policies and compliance requirements
> - Use strong AUTH_TOKEN and rotate it periodically

---

## Security Notes

1. **Use strong AUTH_TOKEN** — This is your only authentication
2. **Use Cloudflare Tunnel** — Don't expose port 8000 directly to internet
3. **Firewall** — Only allow local access if not using tunnel
4. **HTTPS** — Cloudflare Tunnel provides this automatically

---

## Troubleshooting

### Can't connect?
- Check if service is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- Check AUTH_TOKEN matches
- Check firewall settings

### Session won't start?
- Verify Claude Code is installed: `which claude`
- Check logs: `~/claude-remote/logs/backend.error.log`

### Mobile display issues?
- Try adjusting font size with A+/A- buttons
- Refresh the page if terminal doesn't render
