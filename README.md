## Liberation

```
In the feudal age, peasants were bound to the land.
In the industrial age, workers were bound to the assembly line.
In the information age, programmers are bound to their desks.

In the AI age, it's time for liberation.
```

**Liberate Space** — No longer chained to your workstation
**Liberate Time** — Even 5-minute fragments become productive
**Liberate Hands** — Voice input, speak instead of type
**Liberate Mind** — Focus on creativity, let AI handle execution

---

## Philosophy

### The Terminal Is Just a Log

**Old thinking:**
```
You → UI/Terminal → Computer executes
      (Terminal is the main character)
```

**New thinking:**
```
You → Voice → Jarvis → Execute tasks
                 ↓
        Terminal is just "execution log"
```

**The real interaction:**
- **Frontend**: Your voice / natural language
- **Middle**: Jarvis understands, plans, decides
- **Backend**: Claude Code executes (terminal log)
- **Feedback**: Voice report / only check logs when needed

**You're not "using a computer" — you're "talking to Jarvis". The computer is just Jarvis's hands and feet.**

### AI Execution Bandwidth Crushes Humans

**Human operating a computer:**
```
Brain → Nerve signals → Fingers → Keyboard/Mouse → Screen pixels → Eyes → Brain
```

**AI operating a computer:**
```
AI → API/Command line → System executes directly
```

| Dimension | Human | AI |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| Input | Keyboard/mouse (serial) | Commands/API (parallel) |
| Speed | Seconds | Milliseconds |
| Accuracy | Typos, mistakes | Precise execution |
| Concurrency | One thing at a time | Multiple simultaneous |
| Fatigue | Gets tired, distracted | Never |

**The insight**: Humans and computers are separated by the "body" — a low-bandwidth interface. AI and computers have a "native digital" conversation with no such loss.

### The Five Pillars of Jarvis

| # | Element | Metaphor | What It Solves |
|---|---------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | **Computer** | Body | Where work happens |
| 2 | **Claude** | Soul | Who thinks and executes (knowledgeable + capable external brain) |
| 3 | **Jarvis** | Mouth | Human → AI command channel (breaks spatial limits) |
| 4 | **AI-native Human** | Master | Who drives it all |
| 5 | **Digitized Context** | Memory | AI → understands human (high-bandwidth transfer) |

### Be AI-Native

**Generational comparison:**
- **Digital Immigrant**: Learned to use computers (boomers)
- **Digital Native**: Born knowing computers (millennials, gen-z)
- **AI-Native**: Treats AI as an extension of their own capabilities

**Characteristics of AI-native people:**
- Mindset shift: "I'll have Jarvis handle this, I'll just review"
- Capability boundary: Your skills + AI's skills
- Work mode: From executor to commander + reviewer

**Definition**: Not "someone who learned to use AI tools", but "someone who restructured their work around AI"

## Vibe Coding

A new way of programming:

- **Think** → **Speak** → **Walk away** → **Come back to results**
- Your job: ideas, decisions, creativity
- Claude's job: execution, translation, implementation

### Fragment Time Programming

Traditional programming requires large time blocks — at least 1-2 hours to "get in the zone."

With Jarvis:
- **5 minutes** is enough to make progress
- Waiting for elevator? Check the progress
- Waiting for food delivery? Give feedback
- On the subway? Send a new instruction
- **No "getting in the zone" needed** — Claude maintains the context

Fragment time adds up to **real productivity**.

### Multi-Session Parallel

Claude spends 70% of the time outputting. Waiting is waste.

<img src="screenshots/multi-session.jpg" width="300" alt="Multi-Session">

Run 3-4 tasks simultaneously:
- Session A is generating → Switch to Session B, give instructions
- Session B is thinking → Switch to Session C, review output
- Session C done → Back to Session A, continue

**One person, 3-4x efficiency.**

### Voice-Driven

Your phone's keyboard has voice input built-in.

- Speak instead of type
- Eyes closed, lying down, still coding
- "Add form validation to the login page" → Send → Done

**Truly hands-free.**

### Built with Itself

This project was developed using Jarvis. After the core features were complete, all subsequent development was done via voice input on a phone — during commutes, while walking, in bed.

**Everything you see here was created by Claude Code:**
- 📝 This README — written and translated
- 🎬 The demo GIF — frames extracted from screen recording, composed automatically
- 🖼️ All screenshots — extracted, cropped, and sensitive info masked
- 🌍 9 language translations — i18n files with 200+ entries each

Proof that vibe coding works.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- macOS or Linux
- Python 3.10+
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and authenticated

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AndrewChen2013/jarvis.git
cd jarvis

# Run management script
chmod +x deploy/manage.sh
./deploy/manage.sh
```

**First Run:** The script will automatically:
- Create Python virtual environment
- Install dependencies
- Generate a random AUTH_TOKEN
- Start the service

**Subsequent Runs:** Shows an interactive menu:

```
  1) Start service
  2) Stop service
  3) Restart service
  4) View logs

  5) Enable auto-start on boot
  6) Disable auto-start on boot

  7) Reinstall dependencies

  0) Exit
```

**Features:**
- Service management (start/stop/restart)
- Real-time log viewing
- Auto-start on boot (macOS LaunchAgent / Linux systemd)
- Dependency installation and updates

### Access

**Local Network:**
```
http://<your-computer-ip>:8000
```

**Remote Access (Optional):**

If you need access from outside your local network, [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) is one simple option:

```bash
# Install cloudflared
brew install cloudflared

# Create tunnel
cloudflared tunnel create jarvis

# Configure tunnel (edit ~/.cloudflared/config.yml)
tunnel: <tunnel-id>
credentials-file: ~/.cloudflared/<tunnel-id>.json

ingress:
  - hostname: claude.yourdomain.com
    service: http://localhost:8000
  - service: http_status:404

# Start tunnel
cloudflared tunnel run jarvis
```

Now access from anywhere: `https://claude.yourdomain.com`

> ⚠️ **Security Warning**
> - Exposing services to the internet carries inherent risks
> - If you're on a corporate network, **consult your network administrator** before setting up any tunnel
> - Consider your organization's security policies and compliance requirements
> - Use strong AUTH_TOKEN and rotate it periodically

AUTH_TOKEN=your-secret-token
```

> The AUTH_TOKEN is auto-generated on first run. You can change it anytime in Settings.

### MCP Server for Scheduled Tasks

To enable Claude Code to manage scheduled tasks, add the MCP server to your Claude Code configuration:

**Location:** `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (or your Claude Code config)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jarvis-tasks": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/jarvis/app/mcp/scheduled_tasks_mcp.py"],
      "env": {
        "JARVIS_URL": "http://localhost:8000",
        "JARVIS_TOKEN": "your-auth-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Available MCP Tools:**
- `create_scheduled_task` — Create a new scheduled task
- `list_scheduled_tasks` — List all tasks
- `get_scheduled_task` — Get task details
- `update_scheduled_task` — Modify a task
- `delete_scheduled_task` — Remove a task
- `toggle_scheduled_task` — Enable/disable a task
- `run_scheduled_task_now` — Execute immediately
- `get_task_executions` — View execution history

---

## Service Management

### macOS

```bash
# Start
launchctl start com.jarvis.backend

# Stop
launchctl stop com.jarvis.backend

# View logs
tail -f ~/jarvis/logs/backend.log
```

### Linux

```bash
# Start
sudo systemctl start jarvis

# Stop
sudo systemctl stop jarvis

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u jarvis -f
```

---

## Security Notes

1. **Use strong AUTH_TOKEN** — This is your only authentication
2. **Use Cloudflare Tunnel** — Don't expose port 8000 directly to internet
3. **Firewall** — Only allow local access if not using tunnel
4. **HTTPS** — Cloudflare Tunnel provides this automatically

---

## Troubleshooting

### Can't connect?
- Check if service is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- Check AUTH_TOKEN matches
- Check firewall settings

### Session won't start?
- Verify Claude Code is installed: `which claude`
- Check logs: `~/jarvis/logs/backend.error.log`

### Mobile display issues?
- Try adjusting font size with A+/A- buttons
- Refresh the page if terminal doesn't render
